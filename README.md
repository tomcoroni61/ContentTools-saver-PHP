# ContentTools-saver-PHP
Save html files by php edited with ContentTools

It is thought to run on Windows 10 Webserver.
Edit and save your Homepage there (local on your pc) and then upload/update with ftp.

No Setup needed only little change to start.

Little help and more in english und deutsch is included.
